                       technology. There is one big stadium for cricket, and two general purpose small sports grounds. The whole campus is
                       covered with security cameras installed after every 100 meters, while go-through gates at the entrance add to the security
                       to make it as fool proof as possible. In short there is everything you would expect to find in a well renowed international

                       almost 1000 is situated at the center of the campus, having proper acoustics and lightning. The auditorium remains
                       open the whole year for studetns to showcase their talents and exhibit their performances in the field of science and
                       technology. There is one big stadium for cricket, and two general purpose small sports grounds. The whole campus is
                       covered with security cameras installed after every 100 meters, while go-through gates at the entrance add to the security
                       to make it as fool proof as possible. In short there is everything you would expect to find in a well renowed international
                       institute, so no need of getting abroad and waste your money, just walk towards MIA!
